How to play a TAINT game?
===========================

In order to play a TAINT game, all you need is a TAINT interpreter. While you are free to build your own interpreter, chances are you want to focus on game creation rather than programming!

Well, don't worry, since we have already taken care of this and provided a cross-platform web application for TAINT game playback!

There are two default interpreters, a simple python interpreter (also used when testing games in the `editor`) and a web application interpreter, built using Google's AppEngine.
